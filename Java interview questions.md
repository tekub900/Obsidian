# What are the Memory Allocations available in JavaJava?

Java has five significant types of memory allocations.

- Class Memory
- Heap Memory
- Stack Memory
- Program Counter-Memory
- Native Method Stack Memory
# What are the differences between Heap and Stack Memory in Java?

Stack memory in data structures is the amount of memory allocated to each individual programme. It is a fixed memory space. Heap memory, in contrast, is the portion that was not assigned to the Java code but will be available for use by the Java code when it is required, which is generally during the program's runtime.
# Will the program run if we write static public void main?

Yes, the program will successfully execute if written so. Because, in Java, there is no specific rule for the order of specifiers
# What is a singleton class in Java? And How to implement a singleton class?

A class that can possess only one object at a time is called a singleton class. To implement a singleton class given steps are to be followed:

1. Make sure that the class has only one object
2. Give global access to that object
# Define package in [[Java]].

The package is a collective bundle of classes and interfaces and the necessary libraries and JAR files. The use of packages helps in code reusability.
# Differentiate between instance and local variables.

For instance, variables are declared inside a class, and the scope of variables in javascript is limited to only a specific object.

A local variable can be anywhere inside a method or a specific block of code. Also, the scope is limited to the code segment where the variable is declared.
